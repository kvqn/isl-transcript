# Creating the model

Create a model using neural networks.
Use datasets available on Kaggle.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathumarikeri/indian-sign-language-isl

the above dataset does not contain 0

get 0 from the ASL dataset

# Creating the notebook

Create a Jupyter notebook explaining the model above. Include some performance and accuracy statistics.

# Python CLI

Create a python CLI to interact with the model.
You should be able to train and test the model using commands without writing unique python code every time.

`py main.py train`
`py main.py predict <image_path>`

# GUI

Create a GUI (or webpage?) that would use the camera, and use the model to tell which character is being displayed on the camera.
Run this prediction every few seconds and provide a live transcript.

# Creating README

README describing the entire project.
